# Introduction

Hello! This is the github repository for the ideallized modelling component of [Geostrophically Constrained Flow of Warm Subsurface Waters Into Geometrically Complex Ice Shelf Cavities](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.170594141.13133501/v1) . 

The code for creating the MITgcm runs is in the newexp and newexp\_utils folders. The file with most of the model setup is newexp/setParams.m and to a lesser extent newexp/newexp.m


The analysis and graphing code is contained in the analysis folder.


If you are interested in running or just have questions reading the software please reach out to me at gdf@ucla.edu it would make my day!
